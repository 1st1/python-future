past.magic
==========
The ``past.magic`` module provides an import hook for Python 3 which runs 2to3
over the code on import to convert print statements into functions, etc.

It is intended to assist users when porting Python 2.x code to 3.x.

Usage
-----

Once installed on the path, the import hook is invoked as follows:

    >>> from past import magic
    >>> magic.install_hooks()

You can unregister the hook by

    >>> magic.remove_hooks()
