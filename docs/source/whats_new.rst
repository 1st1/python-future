What's new in version 0.8
=========================

Python 2.6 support
------------------

``future`` now includes support for Python 2.6.

To run the ``future`` test suite on Python 2.6, this additional package is needed::

    pip install unittest2

``http.server`` also requires the ``argparse`` package::

    pip install argparse


Unused modules removed
----------------------

The ``future.six`` module has been removed. ``future`` doesn't require ``six``
(and hasn't since version 0.3). If you need support for Python versions before
2.6, ``six`` is the best option. ``future`` and ``six`` can be installed
alongside each other easily if needed.

The unused ``hacks`` module has also been removed from the source tree.
